# webm-wasm 
```
Just like what their repository ReadMe says: "The library consumes raw RGBA32 buffers (4 bytes per pixel) and turns them into a webm video with the given framerate and quality. This makes it compatible out-of-the-box with ImageData from a <canvas>. "
```
Pros:
-Can produce webm videos from RGBA32 buffers
-Can loop video
-Has controls

Cons:
-Cannot trim
-Cannot record video through screen share or webcam
-Cannot record an audio
